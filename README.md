## DOCUMENTATION

* Note: The upload feature may not be working properly

* Note: The API Endpoint is at local host at http://0.0.0.0:105/



###### 1. USING THE COHERE API THROUGH FLASK

To generate 4 random tasks, use the 'GET' method on the extension /category/<string:category>/. 

This should return a JSON of an array of 4 random tasks, given a category. The <string:category> MUST be exactly one of: 'skill', 'academic', 'fitness', or 'wellness'.



###### 2. UPLOADING IMAGES TO THE AWS CLOUD

To upload images to the AWS Cloud, including DynamoDB and S3, use the 'POST' method on the extension /upload.

This should return a JSON message of 'File uploaded successfully', or 'Invalid file type.'



###### 3. DOWNLOADING/GETTING A PHOTO's UNIVERSAL URL AND CAPTION

To get the universal URL and the caption of a photo, use the 'GET' method on the extension /download/<string:postid>, where the postid is the UUID of an image. This is likely not useful as it is a helper function.

This should return the URL and caption in the form {'url': url, 'caption': caption}



###### 4. GETTING A USER's POST HISTORY

To get a user's post history (or equilvalently, all their posts), use the 'GET' method on the extension /history/<string:user>, where user is the username. 

This should return a JSON of each post and their information. The information includes: caption (string), and the universal url (string).  



###### 5. GETTING EVERY POST FROM EACH PERSON EXACTLY ONCE

To get every post from each person exactly once, meaning one person doesn't appear twice, use the 'GET' method on the extension /allposts.

This should return a JSON of each post, including all the information: 'caption' (string), 'image' (universal URL/string), 'postid' (string/UUID), 'user' (string), 'verified' (bool)
